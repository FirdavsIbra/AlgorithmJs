/*
    There is an array of strings. All strings contains similar letters except one. Try to find it!
    Strings may contain spaces. Spaces are not significant, only non-spaces symbols matters. E.g. string that contains only spaces is like empty string.

    Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 2 strings.

    This is the second kata in series:

    Find the unique number
    Find the unique string (this kata)
